        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            We believe education should not only record information — it should
            understand it. Our system empowers institutions to identify learning
            gaps early, guide students effectively, and make informed academic decisions.

                <h3>Student Empowerment</h3>
                <p>
                    Students gain access to personal performance dashboards, academic
                    goal tracking, and digital assessment submissions — promoting
                    responsibility and self-improvement.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="vision-box">
                <h3>Teacher Intelligence</h3>
                <p>
                    Teachers manage assessments, record interventions, and use
                    risk indicators to identify students who need support
                    before academic failure occurs.
                </p>

            <div class="vision-box">
                <h3>Administrative Excellence</h3>
                <p>
                    Administrators oversee the academic ecosystem through analytics,
                    policy thresholds, and centralized user & class management.

                <h3>Secure Authentication</h3>
                <p>
                    Each user accesses the system through a secure login and is
                    redirected to a personalized dashboard based on role.
                </p>

                <h3>Role-Based Intelligence</h3>
                <p>
                    Students, teachers, and administrators interact with unique
                    features designed specifically for their responsibilities.

                <h3>Data-Driven Decisions</h3>
                <p>
                    Academic data is analyzed visually to support early interventions,
                    goal alignment, and institutional planning.
